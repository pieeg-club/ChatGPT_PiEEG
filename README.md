Connect brain-computer interface to ChatGPT

My goal is not to show how stress can be detected in practice, but the main task is to show how ChatGPT can be used, in the future those who are interested can try to implement their ideas. (so everything here is for educational purposes only on how to connect BCI to ChatGPT, this example just clearly demonstrates how it can work in practice).
